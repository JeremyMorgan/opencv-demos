# OpenCV Computer Vision Demos

These are the code examples from my [Computer Vision Power Hour](https://www.twitch.tv/jeremymorgan/schedule?vodID=1773385086).

Demos based on the stream:

23 March 2023:

- [bodydetect.py](https://github.com/JeremyMorgan/opencv-demos/blob/main/bodydetect.py): Reads in an image file and detects full bodies in the image using a Haar Cascade classifier.
- [edge-canny.py](https://github.com/JeremyMorgan/opencv-demos/blob/main/edge-canny.py): Reads in an image file and applies the Canny edge detection algorithm to the image.
- [blurring.py](https://github.com/JeremyMorgan/opencv-demos/blob/main/blurring.py): Reads in an image file, resizes it to fit within a specified output size, and displays the original and resized images.
- [sobel-edge-detection.py](https://github.com/JeremyMorgan/opencv-demos/blob/main/edge-sobel.py): Reads in an image file and applies the Sobel edge detection algorithm to the image.
- [facedetect.py](https://github.com/JeremyMorgan/opencv-demos/blob/main/facedetect.py): Reads in an image file and detects faces in the image using a Haar Cascade classifier.

Each of these scripts demonstrates a different image processing technique using OpenCV.

Stay Tuned for more, and [follow me](https://www.twitch.tv/jeremymorgan/) if you want to view the weekly stream. 

## Running these files

Have Python installed on your machine. 

Create a new Python environment.
