# opencv-demos

These are the code examples from my [Computer Vision Power Hour](https://www.twitch.tv/jeremymorgan/schedule?vodID=1773385086). 


So far we have 

23 March 2023:

- `body-detection.py`: Reads in an image file and detects full bodies in the image using a Haar Cascade classifier.
- `canny-edge-detection.py`: Reads in an image file and applies the Canny edge detection algorithm to the image.
- `image-blurring.py`: Reads in an image file, resizes it to fit within a specified output size, and displays the original and resized images.
- `sobel-edge-detection.py`: Reads in an image file and applies the Sobel edge detection algorithm to the image.

Each of these scripts demonstrates a different image processing technique using OpenCV.
